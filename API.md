# Piece Check - Text Editing Application
## Application Programming Interfaces
### What Are They?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application Programming Interfaces or API's allow you to talk between two applications. The name itself gives quite a lot away. An API is basically an interface for applications to talk to one another.

### Analogies

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API's are quite hard to understand at first. What people give are good analogies of an API might be. Here's one of the some analogies of API's -

Imagine you are in a restraunt and that all the food on the menu are the commands you can use to talk to the API. Then the waiter asks for your request. In this case, the waiter is the API. The API then goes to the other application, in this case, the kitchen and then gives back the desired result, in this case, food (maybe soup).

This analogy comes from a youtube video. The link is just below -

### Connections

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ginger-It is one of the two applications in the API process. If we connect the analogy with the application, it goes like this - 

We are the Piece Check application and 'Ginger It' is our menu. We ive the API a request and then the response comes back in a JSON format. If you want to see a JSON formatted file, then check out the JSON documentation on this repository.

### A Mix Up

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between a Graphical User Interface and the Application User Interface?

GUI, or  a Graphical User Interface is an interface between the the user and the application whereas a API, or a graphical user interface is an interface between two different applications. You may have noticed that Windows uses GUI to make their system user-friendly.

A link to a video describing GUI in more detail is in the GUI documentation.
