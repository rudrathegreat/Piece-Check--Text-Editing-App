PieceCheck App – English Grammar and Spelling Checker

Ever want an application which shows your English spelling, grammar errors and avoid embarrassing mistakes? Well, why not try PieceCheck.  This is an text editing application where you can write, check and save your texts in a file.

PieceCheck application corrects a vast range of grammar use mistakes. This application not only flags mistakes but also suggests any corrections. It detects grammar and spelling errors in sentences and to correct them with unmatched accuracy. From singular vs plural errors to the most sophisticated sentence or tense usage errors. Here are some examples:

Subject verb agreement, Singular/Plural nouns, Consecutive nouns, Misused words corrections and contextual spelling corrections.

Technology wise, this application is written in Python 3.6 and uses libraries such as TKinter. It is designed to use GingerIT REST API (application programming interface) to check for grammar and spelling mistakes online and presenting mistakes to user in a friendly manner. 

The application has loosely coupled components such as File Management, Widget & display management, Grammar checker, Error handler and is easily replaceable or upgradable.  

The aim of this project is to help other students with their stories and publications. It may help people while they are publishing or it may just be there as a reference. Most students do miss a few mistakes, so it may be used as a second pair of eyes. Plus, it may be an    inspiration for others which is why I put it up here on Git Hub.
